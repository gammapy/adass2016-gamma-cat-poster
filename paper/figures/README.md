# Figures

To produce the Figures, run these commands:

    python allsky.py
    pdf2ps allsky.pdf allsky.eps

    python spec.py
    pdf2ps spec.pdf spec.eps

There's some issue with the EPS generated by matplotlib.
When put in the paper, it isn't placed properly.
If we generate the EPS from the PDF using `pdf2ps` it works fine.
