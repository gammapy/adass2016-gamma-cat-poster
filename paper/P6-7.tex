\begin{abstract} \gammacat\ (\gammacatgh) is an open data collection and source
catalog for TeV gamma-ray astronomy. Currently data from \npapers~papers is
available, and the catalog contains \nsources~sources. Data is input using the
hierarchical, human- and machine-readable \yaml\ format and the tabular \ecsv\
text formats, processed using Python scripts into an as-uniform form as
possible. The data can be browsed on the \gammasky~web page, analyzed using
\gammapy, or fully downloaded in \fits\ and other formats and used in whatever
way the user likes. Data is collected in a git repository on Github, providing
transparency, version control as well as simple maintenance and contribution
workflow. This data repository was started in August 2016, the data collection
as well as the specification of the input and output formats is work in
progress. Here we present the project for the first time, and discuss it's
context, implementation, status, plans as well as some possible use cases for
science analysis. \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The first cosmic TeV gamma-ray source detected from the ground was the Crab
nebula in 1989. Since then, TeV astronomy has seen rapid growth. As of October
2016, \nsources~sources have been detected (see Figure~\ref{fig:allsky}).
Information on the position, morphology, spectra and lightcurves of these
sources have been published by HEGRA, H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC, HAWC and other
telescopes in a few hundred individual papers. There is a need for a
machine-readable, curated, up-to-date collection of TeV source data and a TeV
catalog. Here we give an overview of other TeV gamma-ray data collections and
catalogs in Section~\ref{sec:others}, then present the new project \gammacat\ in
Section~\ref{sec:gammacat} and conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

dataset \citep{fermi-2fhl}.}

\section{Other TeV gamma-ray data collections and catalogs}
\label{sec:others}

For a given paper, the measurements on TeV gamma-ray sources are often not
available in a machine-readable format. Typically the source position,
morphology and spectral model are fitted to the data, and the results of that
fit are given in the paper text. Sometimes, spectral points or lightcurve points
are given in \ascii or \fits format on some webpage, or can be obtained from the
corresponding author. In this section we describe prior efforts to gather
available TeV gamma-ray data. A H.E.S.S. source list is available in HTML
(Hypertext markup language) and CSV (character-separated values) formats at
\hesscat, some spectra and lightcurves of blazars measured by H.E.S.S. in FITS
(Flexible Image Transport system) and VOTable (Virtual Observatory table)
formats at \obspm. Some VERITAS images, lightcurves and spectra in FITS format
are available at \veritasdata. MAGIC at \magicurl. A light curve archive with
FITS and VOTABLE data for some blazars is available at \desylc, which is an
evolution of the data format and dataset described in \citet{lc}.

 % HAWC publications are listed at \hawcdata. At this time, no HAWC data in
 % machine-readable format is available for download yet.

An online TeV source catalog is available at \tevcaturl\ \citep{tevcat}.
\tevcat\ is not available for download, and the terms and conditions page
explicitly forbids scraping the \tevcat\ web page to download a copy of the data. \tevcat\ does not contain spectral points or lightcurve or image data.

The \tegev\ catalog is available at \tgevcaturl\ \citep{tgevcat}. \tegev\ is a
larger collection of data compared to \tevcat, it does include spectral points
and lightcurves. \tegev\ is part of a larger collection of multi-wavelength data
and web-based tools to browse and analyze the data. The \tegev\ data is
available for download in CSV format, downloading all data (including
spectral points and lightcurves) would require scraping the website or contacting the maintainers.

% TODO: should we have such comments here?
% \tevcat\ is usually very up-to-date with newly detected TeV sources and papers, \tegev\ is currently at version 2 from July 2015. In the next

\subsection{An open TeV data collection and catalog}

\gammacat\ (\gammacatgh) is both a \emph{TeV data collection} and a \emph{TeV
source catalog}. The data collection consists of measurements from papers in
machine-readable form. From this collection, a TeV source catalog is derived as
a higher-level data product. The source catalog is somewhat subjective and
doesn't contain all data from the collection. For a given source, usually each
paper contains a set of measurements (e.g. source position, morphology,
spectrum) and for the catalog, the ``best'' available parameters are chosen.
Sometimes, especially for sources in the inner Galactic plane region where the
source density is high, it can even happen that a later higher-resolution image
reveals that what was previously thought of as one ``source'' really consists of
multiple ``sources''. Extra-galactic sources usually don't have this issue of
source confusion, but the most common source class, active galactic nuclei
(AGN), are often variable in flux and spectral shape, implying that no single
measurement can be the ``best''. The source identification and association
status can change over time, as new potential counterparts (e.g. pulsars,
supernova remnants, AGN, \ldots) are discovered in multi-wavelength data. For
these reasons, we consider the \emph{TeV data collection} aspect of primary
importance --- \gammacat\ is a service to the astronomical community where
information from hundreds of individual papers has been collected into a
machine-readable form that can be easily queried and used. The \gammacat\
catalog is a secondary data product that provides a simplified summary of the
available information on TeV gamma-ray sources.

The \gammacat\ scope is not completely decided. Currently the focus is on
collecting the published measurements for source position, morphology, spectrum
and lightcurves for TeV gamma-ray sources, mostly from the past decade and the
H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC and HAWC telescopes. However, if we receive
contributions of similar datasets in machine-readable formats that are not
readily available elsewhere, we will consider adding them (but not exposing them
in the gamma-ray source catalog). Examples that come to mind are: Fermi-LAT
gamma-ray source measurements from individual papers in the GeV--TeV energy
range, TeV gamma-ray diffuse emission measurements or models, cosmic ray
electron spectra. Whether \gammacat\ will remain solely focused on TeV gamma-ray
sources, or will expand to become more of a ``TeV gamma-ray very-high-level
datasets'' repository remains to be seen. Another choice we will have make is
how to expose or merge the information from upcoming TeV source catalogs by
H.E.S.S. and HAWC.

\subsection{Guiding principles and implementation}

The creation of \gammacat\ was inspired by the other open astronomy catalogs at
\astrocats. In the paper describing the \emph{Open supernova catalog},
\citet{sne-cat} explain their guiding principles and describe the resulting
implementation. \gammacat\ is very similar, and in this section we briefly
summarize our guiding principles and implementation.

\emph{\gammacat\ data is fully open-access}. Anyone can download all available
data as a \texttt{zip} file, or clone the git repository to obtain the full
version history of \gammacat\ and use it however they like (except for an
attribution request, which we state in our terms of use). Currently the size is
very small, roughly 1~MB. We expect this to grow over time, but to stay within
the limit of roughly 1~GB that comfortably fits in a single git repository. If
large data files were added at some point (e.g. FITS images), extra repositories
or other data stores could be used.

\emph{\gammacat\ is set up for fully open collaboration}. The input data
collection is stored using the hierarchical, human- and machine-readable \yaml\
format and the tabular \ecsv\ text formats. The output data products (source
catalog, spectra, lightcurves) are created using Python scripts (just run one
command \texttt{python make.py all}). All scripts and Python packages we use are
open-source: PyYAML (\url{http://pyyaml.org/}), Astropy \citep{astropy}, Gammapy
\citep{gammapy} and ADS (\pyads). By making the data, tools and process fully
open, we hope to create a community-driven project with a large scope and
lifetime. Using a git repo and the simple ``collection of text files as
database'' implementation means that the project is not tied to a given data
center, website or researcher. Github pull requests provide a simple way to
accept and review contributions without giving new people write access from the
start.

\subsection{Data formats, products, website, Python tools}

The data products offered for \gammacat\ are a source catalog as well as
per-paper data. The source catalog is a flat table (available in \ecsv, \fits\
and \votable\ format) that contains one row per source with the most important
information listed in a simple format. The catalog does not contain spectral
points or lightcurve points or measurements from all papers for a given source.
The full data available in \gammacat\ is given as a collection of files that are
generated based on collected input \yaml\ and \ecsv\ data, and derived
information from the Python scripts. E.g. we compute the integral flux above
1~TeV according to the best-fit spectral model, even if that number wasn't given
in the paper. Currently we are using \json\ for hierarchical data and \ecsv\ for
tabular output data. Other formats (e.g. \yaml\ or \fits\ and \votable) could
easily be generated as well, this will likely change as we receive feedback on
which formats are preferred by the community. Development of the data format
specifications (e.g. for spectral points or lightcurves) is work in progress and
happens at \gadfurl\ \citep{open-gamma}, the formats we are using now should be
considered unstable prototypes. We have started to develop a Python package,
\texttt{gammapy.catalog} (\gammapycat, \citet{gammapy}), that allows easy
querying of \gammacat\ and working with the data, e.g. plotting spectra or
lightcurves or analyzing them, or generating a TeV sky model from the catalog.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

% Note that none of the other TeV gamma-ray data collections and catalogs we are
% aware of (listed in Section~\ref{sec:others}) is fully open-access and open for
% collaboration like \gammacat. We invite everyone to ...

\gammacat\ is a TeV gamma-ray astronomy data collection and source catalog.
Compared to previous similar projects, \gammacat\ stands out be being fully
open-access and set up in a way that makes maintenance and community
contributions easy, following the lead of other open astronomy catalogs from
\astrocats. Merging of some previous TeV data collections (e.g. the light curve
archive as DESY) as well as communication about possible collaboration is
ongoing. \gammacat\ is being developed in close collaboration with ongoing
efforts to develop gamma-ray data format standards (\gadf), open-source science
tools (\gammapy) as well as a website dedicated to the gamma-ray sky
(\gammasky). \gammacat\ lets you quickly access all published information for
all TeV sources, ready for data exploration or analysis. We hope that this will
be a useful resource for daily work as well as the basis for novel studies
involving the extensive set of available archival gamma-ray data. Concretely we
propose \gammacat\ to be used as one of the inputs to build the sky model for
the planned CTA data challenge. Feedback and contributions to \gammacat\ are
highly welcome!
