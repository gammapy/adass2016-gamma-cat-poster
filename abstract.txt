An open catalog for TeV gamma-ray astronomy

Christoph Deil, Arjun Vorugantia, Axel Donath, Johannes King

The first cosmic TeV gamma-ray source detected from the ground was the Crab
nebula in 1989. Since then TeV astronomy has seen rapid growth. By now, over 160
sources have been detected and position, morphology, spectrum and sometimes
lightcurves measured. Most of that data is reported in individual papers. Often
the source parameters are not given in a machine-readable format, and if it is,
it's usually reported via different measures and in different data formats.

We present an effort to collect the available data on TeV sources and curate it
into an as-uniform as possible format and have it freely available for download
at https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat . This poster will present the project
idea and status, as well as its technical implementation, which includes YAML,
ECSV, JSON and FITS files and Python scripts using Gammapy (http://gammapy.org),
and several other Python packages. A web frontend to browse this TeV source
catalog and other gamma-ray and multi-wavelength data is under development at
http://gamma-sky.net .
