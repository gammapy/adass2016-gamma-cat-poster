The first cosmic TeV gamma-ray source detected from the ground was the Crab
nebula in 1989. Since then, TeV astronomy has seen rapid growth. By now, over
160 sources have been detected. Measurements of source position, morphology,
spectrum and sometimes lightcurves have been published, mostly in individual
papers. Often the source parameters are not given in a machine-readable format,
and even if they are, there is no common data format.

We present an effort to collect the available data on TeV sources, and curate it
into an as-uniform and as-complete as possible form, and have it freely
available for download at https://github.com/gammapy/gamma-cat . This poster
presents the project idea and status, as well as its technical implementation,
which includes YAML, ECSV, JSON and FITS files and Python scripts using Gammapy
(http://gammapy.org), and several other Python packages. A web front-end to
browse this TeV source catalog and other gamma-ray and multi-wavelength data is
under development at http://gamma-sky.net .
